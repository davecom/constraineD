===========

Constraint Satisfaction Problem Solver for Dart that uses a basic backtracking algorithm.
It has no external dependencies and currently works. It is quite slow due to unimplemented optimizations like MAC3 and LCV.

It does however support the MRV optimization.

## Examples
There are examples of SEND + MORE = MONEY, the Australian Map Coloring Problem, and a couple circuit board layout problems in the *test* directory.
