===========

Constraint Satisfaction Problem Solver for Dart that uses a basic backtracking algorithm.
It has no external dependencies and currently works. It is quite slow due to unimplemented optimizations like MAC3 and LCV.

It does however support the MRV optimization.

## Examples
There are examples of SEND + MORE = MONEY and the Australian Map Coloring problems in the test directory.
